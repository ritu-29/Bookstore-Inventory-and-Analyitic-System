🧠 Concepts Explained

1️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
	•	Class: Used to define the structure of a book
	•	Object: Represents a real book entry
	•	Methods: Perform operations like add, view, search, update, delete

2️⃣ File Handling
	•	Stores book data in a file
	•	Prevents data loss after program exit
	•	Uses read (r), write (w), append (a) modes

3️⃣ Menu-Driven Program
	•	Displays multiple options
	•	User selects an option using numbers
	•	Program runs continuously until exit is chosen
